sliding window
    when you need to process a series of data elements like a list or string.
    you look for specific things in the list by looking at a smaller part of the list at a time. 

s = ["a","b","c","d","e","f"]
window = ["b", "c"]

window defintion: 
    the small part is called window. The window slides one step until the entire list is scanned. 

When to use sliding window method?

    Inputs are mostlikely a linear data structure, arrays, linked list, or strings. 
    You have to find shortest or longest substring or subarray that satisfies particular condition.
